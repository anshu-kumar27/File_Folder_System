# 📁 File Folder System in C++

> 🚀 A console-based file/folder management system created using **pure DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** — all implemented manually without built-in libraries.  
> Created using **C++** as a core learning project for practicing arrays, queues, searching, and sorting.

## 🧠 Description

This project simulates a basic file and folder structure, allowing the user to manage folders and their respective files through a **menu-driven interface**.  
It mimics how actual file systems work — but at a simplified level — built completely using **custom data structures**.
